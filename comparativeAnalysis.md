# Final Verdict

Prompt B (CRAFT Format) is the more effective prompt overall. While Prompt A provides a useful direct template, Prompt B offers a more comprehensive and adaptable framework that will likely produce better results across different scenarios and user needs. The CRAFT format's structured approach ensures that all essential elements are considered, while still maintaining flexibility for customization.
