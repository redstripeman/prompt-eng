# Research Question 

Can we develop a universal meta-prompt template that consistently produces superior results compared to alternative prompting methods?

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

* Various prompting techniques exist but lack standardization
* The quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on prompt construction
* Context and role-playing improve LLM responses
* Different experts propose different prompting strategies
* Prompt engineering is often more art than science

#### What this research is exploring

* We employ a structured CRAFT framework (Context, Role, Action, Format, Target)
* We are building a standardized approach to meta-prompt creation
* We are exploring the effectiveness of priming sequences in LLM interactions
* We are testing the repeatability and consistency of structured prompts

#### Implications for practice

* It will standardize prompt creation across different use cases
* It will improve consistency in LLM outputs
* It will reduce the learning curve for prompt engineering
* It will enable better quality control in AI-generated content
* It will facilitate prompt sharing and modification across teams

# Research Method

The research employs a systematic approach through the CRAFT framework:

1. Framework Development
   * Created structured sections for Context, Role, Action, Format, and Target
   * Established clear guidelines for each section
   * Developed templated approaches for different use cases

2. Testing and Validation
   * Testing the framework across different LLM models
   * Comparing outputs with traditional prompting methods
   * Gathering feedback on prompt effectiveness

3. Iterative Refinement
   * Incorporating learned insights
   * Optimizing section requirements
   * Standardizing best practices

# Results

[Initial findings](comparativeAnalysis.md) suggest that the CRAFT framework:
* Produces more consistent outputs across different prompting scenarios
* Reduces the need for prompt iteration and refinement
* Creates more detailed and focused responses
* Enables better control over LLM outputs
* Facilitates prompt sharing and modification

The approach used in obtaining the findings followed these steps: 

1. Request the LLM create a prompt for topic T.  The resulting prompt is A.
2. Request the [CRAFT](meta-prompt.md) Meta-Prompt template to create a prompt for topic T.  The resulting prompt is B.
3. Request the [CRAFT](meta-prompt.md) Meta-Prompt template to create a Prompt Comparison Tool (PCT) based upon [Prompt Criteria](prompt_comparison_criteria.md)
4. Use the PCT to evaluate prompt A and prompt B

Using the above approach, where topic T = "Create a prompt that helps patent inventors write their disclosures."

1.  [Prompt A](promptA.md) was generated directly by the large languge model
2.  [Prompt B](promptB.md) was generated indirectly by  [CRAFT](meta-prompt.md) Meta-Prompt Template
3.  [PCT](prompt_comparison.md) was generated by the [CRAFT](meta-prompt.md)
4.  PCT was executed against promptA and promptB to generate the [Comparative Analysis Report](comparativeAnalysis.md) demonstrating (*Final Verdict*) that meta-prompting using the CRAFT template out-performed meta-prompting without it.




# Further research

Future research directions could include:

1. Quantitative Analysis
   * Measuring output quality metrics
   * Comparing performance across different LLM models
   * Analyzing consistency across multiple runs

2. Framework Extensions
   * Developing specialized CRAFT variations for specific domains
   * Framing CRAFT in XML or JSON for dynamic modifications at runtime
   * Creating automated tools for CRAFT prompt generation
   * Incorporating feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement

3. Best Practices Development
   * Creating a library of proven CRAFT templates
   * Developing guidelines for different use cases
   * Establishing metrics for prompt quality assessment
